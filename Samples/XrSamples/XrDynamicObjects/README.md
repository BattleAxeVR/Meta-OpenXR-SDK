# OpenXR Dynamic Object Tracker Sample

## Overview
The extension `XR_META_dynamic_object_tracker` provides the ability for the headset to detect and track an object class.
The extension `XR_META_dynamic_object_keyboard` allows the runtime to track keyboard objects using the tracker extension.

## The Sample
This sample opens to a panel that displays the state of the internal API calls. If the extension is enabled successfully and a keyboard is detected,
the application will display a passthrough window showing the user's keyboard.
